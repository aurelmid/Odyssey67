 ### Update: The PCB is now on Rev 2.1; it has been updated due to some minor clearance issues (stabilizers overlapping diodes). The plates are on Rev 2.0; two holes have been added for better support.

 A simple and practical 65% mechanical keyboard powered by the Elite-C microcontroller.

## Build Guide

 If you're new to this, make sure to study and follow the build guide available [here](https://github.com/aurelmid/Odyssey67/blob/master/BUILD_GUIDE.md).

## Firmware

 The keyboard is powered by [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). You can find the firmware for the Odyssey67 [here](https://github.com/aurelmid/Odyssey67/tree/master/Firmware/aurelmid/odyssey67).

 Add the `aurelmid` folder to your own fork of QMK to flash it to your keyboard.

 If you're new to QMK, please take the time to learn all the ins and outs and familiarize yourself with it by reading the [official documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/).
